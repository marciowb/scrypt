scrypt
======

The [scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html) key derivation function in Javascript.  Heavily based on ~~https://github.com/cheongwy/node-scrypt-js~~ (repository is gone, see [here](https://github.com/scintill/scrypt/tree/npm/node-scrypt-js) for my attempt to recover it from npm) but mine is meant to be more lightweight (one file), works in both browser and NodeJS, and can multi-thread in browsers.
